# Spotify Charts Analysis Project
Developed by vuthayak (Student from University of Waterloo).

This program aims to demonstrate applications of data science + machine learning through python libraries (`pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `tensorflow`, `scikit-learn`) and principals (**neural networks**, **feature engineering**, **data visualization**). Dataset used is 'Spotify Top Songs and Audio Features' (V1) by Juliano Orlandi on Kaggle.

## Instructions
Program is run through `analysis.py` and executes in the terminal. There are 5 actions to choose from:

    [0] Show all tracks in Spotify Top 200 Charts for an artist

    [1] Show songs with the longest time on Spotify Top 200 Charts

    [2] Predict how long a song will stay on Spotify Top 200 Charts based on features

    [3] Predict how long a song will stay on Spotify Top 200 Charts based on the artist

    [4] Visualize comparisons of 2 features
